**Everything collection 📚**
==========================

A collection of scripts for fixing repeating issues, starting applications; OS-specific quirks. Also, some contributions here too. Maybe you'll find my work useful! 🙂

### Most files from this repo were moved to my Gists. [Check 'em out](https://gist.github.com/kekneus373)

**Contents (what's left)**
------------

* `nixos/samba-missing-mount-cifs-wrapper` - my first contribution try. Didn't go as planned 🫤
* `lxcbr0.md` - the first time AI helped me in ONE message. It was Claude Sonnet in Leo AI btw . Overall, I almost lost my mind configuring LXC - [see more](https://gist.github.com/kekneus373/6153edf5a3754fc865112d2c5cf6c32b)
* `run-kdenlive-nixos.bash` - *how I run Kdenlive AppImage in NixOS. Directly related to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kekneus373/2749f51aafba92751ff767262406b3be)
