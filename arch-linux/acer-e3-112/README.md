2026 Acer Aspire BayTrail-based Notebook Comeback
=================================================

## Little Background

You heard it right. I gave up on this Celeron box in spring 2025(4?), although did not send it to bin at that time. I hoped that one day I could retreat myself and finna give it some shape to be usable as a daily-driver.

In February 2026, I was determined to finish this project. And came back. That was such an experience to find a root cause of random hanging issues, not only related to [CState Bug](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=220716). I'm gonna upload a whole ChatGPT convo with me looking for a fix that wasn't obvious nor trackable at all. Stay tuned 🤙
