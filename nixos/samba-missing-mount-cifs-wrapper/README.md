# My first contribution

In July, when I first tried NixOS, I experienced a bug where I can't mount Samba shares as a user. I asked for help, where you can find all the details and how it was resolved: [NixOS Discourse post](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/cant-mount-samba-share-as-a-user/49171?u=kekneus373)
I said that I could test the PR in a week. Of course something must have gone wrong...

1. The test machine replaced a failing server, so I couldn't plug in my hard drive somewhere else as I didn't have another PC;
2. The most cringe part - I had no clue how to actually test it;
3. In the end, I gave up. Had a lot of other, more important work to do.

I'm sorry that I started the entire thing but then just disappeared. Today, I've been curious was it simple or not, so [I asked ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/670c21eb-2604-8001-8ad7-1f2dd011f3e7). I think it tells even better than [the official manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-nixos-tests), where I didn't understand even one word :moyai::moyai::moyai:
I hope this artictle was interesting for you ) . Have a nice day and take care :grinning:
